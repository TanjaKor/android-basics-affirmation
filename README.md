> This app is a part of Unit 2 in "Android Developers Android Basic in Kotlin"-course. An app that shows you list of affirmations with inspiring image using cards.  I had done the recyclerview list in earlier exercise and I used that application as a starting point. My tasks were to add images to the list items (affirmations) and polish the UI.
